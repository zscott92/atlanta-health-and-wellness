The integrative approach to care puts the client(s) at the center of the treatment and addresses the full range of emotional, physical, mental, social, spiritual, and environmental influences that can affect a person's health and well-being. This model uses an individualized, personal approach that takes into consideration a person's unique circumstances and needs. The goal is to help a client establish or restore optimum health and wellness. A wide array of interventions are utilized from a range of scientific disciplines. It is for that reason that a collaborative approach is so integral to its success. We work with individuals of all ages, couples, families and groups of any ethnicity and sexual orientation.

We offer a wide variety of groups and specialized services which can enhance any outpatient mental health program and/or serve as an aftercare program (aftercare Ã  la carte at AC4W) once higher levels of care are completed. What we have discovered in our decades of work as clinicians, is that it takes a village to support a village!")
